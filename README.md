levenshtein
===========

This repository contains source code scraped from Neil Van Dyke's
levenshtein planet package.  It was LGPL3, and I preserved that.

It also consists of files that were automatically generated...I'm
ruining that by taking those generated sources and modifying them,
so I've made an effort to change as little as possible, to simplify
the task of merging changes.

This package has no PLaneT dependencies. (That was sort of the whole
point of the exercise.)
